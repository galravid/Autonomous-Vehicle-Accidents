# Autonomous Vehicle Accidents
The project is about analyzing autonomous vehicle road accidents and proposing a human-engineering solution to the problems that arose from the data. First, the data was understood: a comprehensive dataset from California, which included 646 accidents between the years 2019–2024. The information was cleaned and reduced to 57 key variables, analyzed using Python, and managed on GitHub. The analysis findings indicated that autonomous vehicle accidents occur at a higher rate than conventional vehicles at night and in the early morning hours, mainly at intersections and in certain geographic locations.
The main problems identified are related to night-time detection limitations, intersection complexity, the effect of days of the week, weather conditions, geographic accident locations, and the interaction between human drivers and autonomous vehicles. From the set of problems, one problem was selected to focus on: the high number of accidents involving autonomous vehicles in situations with increased risk – night, intersections and geographic centers. Existing studies from recent years reinforce this finding and show that autonomous vehicles have particular difficulty in these situations.
To understand the users, interviews were conducted with three representative subjects: the owner of a vehicle with autonomous mode, a regular driver who drives at intersections in the early morning hours, and a veteran vehicle designer. The findings indicate that users expect transparency, reliability and control, while regular drivers fear the unexpected behavior of autonomous vehicles. Professionals in the field point to a gap between technological promises and the actual user experience.
The proposed solution is a three-mode smart system that is embedded in the vehicle screen and combines a navigation map with visual, audio and textual alerts. The system offers three modes: normal, adaptive, and take control, depending on the level of risk. It is based on real-time analysis of accident data, time of day, and road conditions, and alerts the driver in a graduated manner to increase alertness and prevent accidents. Its main advantages are improved safety, increased public trust, and a personalized multi-sensory interface, while its disadvantages include an overload of alerts, driver dependence, and technical complexity.
To evaluate the solution, a driving simulator experiment with dozens of subjects is proposed (bonus section). The experiment will compare normal mode with use of the system, in nighttime, intersection, and accident hotspot scenarios. Objective metrics such as response time and taking control will be measured, alongside subjective metrics such as trust and safety. The success of the solution will be measured by a decrease in the number of accidents and an increase in the users’ sense of security.
In summary, the project combines empirical data analysis, user research, and innovative prototype development with the aim of reducing autonomous vehicle accidents in high-risk situations and improving the user experience in advanced driving systems.
