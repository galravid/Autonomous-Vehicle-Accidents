# Autonomous Vehicle Accidents
## Summary
The project focuses on analyzing autonomous vehicle accidents and proposing a human–engineering solution to the problems identified in the data. The analysis was based on a comprehensive dataset from California, including 646 accidents between 2019–2024. The data was cleaned and reduced to 57 key variables, analyzed using Python, and managed via GitHub. Findings revealed that autonomous vehicle accidents occur at higher rates than conventional ones at night and in early morning hours, mainly at intersections and certain geographic hotspots.

The main issues identified involve limitations in nighttime detection, intersection complexity, the influence of weekdays, weather conditions, geographic accident clusters, and interactions between human and autonomous drivers. The project focuses on one key problem: the high frequency of autonomous vehicle accidents in high-risk situations — night, intersections, and specific locations. Recent studies support these findings, showing that autonomous vehicles particularly struggle under these conditions.

To understand users, interviews were conducted with three representative participants: an autonomous vehicle owner, a conventional driver who drives through intersections in the early morning, and an experienced car designer. The results indicate that users expect transparency, reliability, and control, while conventional drivers fear unpredictable behavior from autonomous vehicles. Professionals highlight a gap between technological promises and actual user experience.

The proposed solution is a smart three-mode in-car system integrated into the vehicle display, combining a navigation map with visual, auditory, and tactile alerts. The system offers three modes — *Normal*, *Adaptive*, and *Take Control* — based on risk level. It uses real-time analysis of accident data, time of day, and road conditions to issue graduated alerts that enhance driver awareness and prevent accidents. Its key advantages include improved safety, increased public trust, and a personalized multi-sensory interface, while drawbacks include alert overload, driver dependence, and technical complexity.

To evaluate the solution, a driving simulator experiment (bonus stage) is proposed with dozens of participants. The test will compare regular driving with system-assisted driving in night, intersection, and hotspot scenarios. Both objective measures (reaction time, control takeover) and subjective measures (trust, perceived safety) will be assessed. Success will be determined by reduced accident rates and increased user confidence.

In conclusion, the project integrates empirical data analysis, user research, and innovative prototype development to reduce autonomous vehicle accidents in high-risk conditions and enhance user experience in advanced driving systems.
