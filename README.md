# Autonomous-Vehicle-Accidents
The project analyzes 646 autonomous vehicle accidents (2019–2024) to identify key risk factors - nighttime, intersections, and specific locations. It proposes a smart three-mode in-car system (“Normal,” “Adaptive,” “Take Control”) that enhances safety, trust, and driver awareness through real-time alerts.
